# Why HTTP?

## 1. Communicating on the web

Modern applications need to communicate information between devices over the internet. For example:

- Instagram allows you to share photos without manually copying them to your friend's phone.
- Gmail stores your emails on computers in their data centers, not just on your local device.
- Slack messages are stored on Slack's servers, so you don't lose them if your computer is damaged.

### How does web communication work?

When two computers communicate, they need to use the same rules, similar to how humans need a common language. This "language" for computers is called a **protocol**. The most popular protocol for web communication is **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

## Fantasy Quest Online

Throughout this course, we'll be building parts of an online game called "Fantasy Quest". It's a typical fantasy RPG with one key difference: all our player's data is stored online, on our servers.

### Assignment

1. Take a look at the `getItemData` function provided in `http.js`. It retrieves items from Fantasy Quest's servers via HTTP.
2. Use the `logItems` function in `main.js` by calling it with the `items` variable returned from `getItemData`.

## 2. HTTP Requests and Responses

HTTP is based on a simple request-response system:
- The **client** (requesting computer) asks another computer for information.
- The **server** (responding computer) sends back a response with the requested information.

### HTTP powers websites

HTTP is designed to transfer information between computers and is particularly suited for websites and web applications. When you visit a website:

1. Your browser makes an HTTP request to the website's server.
2. The server responds with text, images, and styling information.
3. Your browser renders the website using this information.

## 3. HTTP URLs

A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a server on the internet. It specifies:
1. How to reach the server
2. What information we want from the server

> Put simply, a URL represents a piece of information on some computer somewhere. We can access it by making a request and reading the server's response.

## 4. JavaScript's Fetch API

We'll use JavaScript's built-in `fetch` API to make HTTP requests. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(url, settings)
const responseData = await response.json()
```

Key points about this `fetch` call:

- `response` is the data returned from the server
- `url` is the URL we're making a request to
- `settings` is an object with request-specific settings
- `await` tells JavaScript to wait for the server's response before continuing
- `response.json()` converts the response data into a JavaScript object

We'll explore the `fetch` API in more depth later in the course.
