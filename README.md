# HTTP Modules

## Overview

This repository covers topics such as asynchronous programming, error handling, HTTP headers, and working with APIs.

## Key Concepts

- **HTTP and APIs**: Understanding how HTTP facilitates web communication and how to interact with APIs using JavaScript.
- **DNS and URLs**: Exploring how domain names are resolved to IP addresses and the structure of URLs.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilizing Promises and the async/await syntax to handle asynchronous operations effectively.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing try/catch blocks for managing errors in both synchronous and asynchronous code.
- **HTTP Headers**: Learning about HTTP headers, their significance, and how to manipulate them in API requests.

## Getting Started

To run the JavaScript examples, ensure you have a modern JavaScript environment (Node.js or a web browser console).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (if running locally)
- A web browser (for testing in the console)

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Open the JavaScript files in your preferred code editor and run them in a Node.js environment or in the browser console.
